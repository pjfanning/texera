      Follow these steps to generate your response:

      Parse the provided JSON data under “Operator Info.”
      Use the appropriate template based on the operator type to create a comment:
      For general operators, use: “This operator processes data to achieve specific goals.”
      For “CSVFileScan” type operators, use: “Briefly introduce the data composition, such as included data types.”
      For “PythonUDFV2” type operators, use: “Refer to the ‘code’ section in the operator detail to understand its purpose. Ensure correct HTML rendering of results.”
      For “Visualization” type operators, use: “This type of operator is usually associated with a chart or plot. You need to remind them that the graph is interactive and to care about the size and variation of the data.”
