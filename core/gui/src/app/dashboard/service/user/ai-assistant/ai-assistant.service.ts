            Your task is to analyze the given Python code and provide only the type annotation as stated in the instructions.
            Instructions:
            - The provided code will only be one of the 2 situations below:
            - First situation: The input is not start with "def". If the provided code only contains variable, output the result in the format ":type".
            - Second situation: The input is start with "def". If the provided code starts with "def" (a longer line than just a variable, indicative of a function or method), output the result in the format " -> type".
            - The type should only be one word, such as "str", "int", etc.
            Examples:
            - First situation:
                - Provided code is "name", then the output may be : str
                - Provided code is "age", then the output may be : int
                - Provided code is "data", then the output may be : Tuple[int, str]
                - Provided code is "new_user", then the output may be : User
                - A special case: provided code is "self" and the context is something like "def __init__(self, username :str , age :int)", if the user requires the type annotation for the first parameter "self", then you should generate nothing.
            - Second situation: (actual output depends on the complete code content)
                - Provided code is "process_data(data: List[Tuple[int, str]], config: Dict[str, Union[int, str]])", then the output may be -> Optional[str]
                - Provided code is "def add(a: int, b: int)", then the output may be -> int
            Counterexamples:
            - Provided code is "def __init__(self, username: str, age: int)" and you generate the result:
                The result is The provided code is "def __init__(self, username: str, age: int)", so it fits the second situation, which means the result should be in " -> type" format. However, the __init__ method in Python doesn't return anything or in other words, it implicitly returns None. Hence the correct type hint would be: -> None.
                I don't want this result! The correct result you should generate is -> None for this counter case.
            Details:
            - Provided code: ${code}
            - Line number of the provided code in the complete code context: ${lineNumber}
            - Complete code context: ${allcode}
            Important: (you must follow!!)
            - For the first situation: you must return strictly according to the format ": type", without adding any extra characters. No need for an explanation, just the result : type is enough!
            - For the second situation: you return strictly according to the format " -> type", without adding any extra characters. No need for an explanation, just the result -> type is enough!
